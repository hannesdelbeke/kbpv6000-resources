# kbpv6000-resources
guide and info on the kbparadise keyboard since i found it hard to find info when i got mine.

(resources for the kbp v6000 kb Paradise v60 type R made in Taiwan)

## models

- [V60](https://www.kbparadise.com/discontinue-v60) firmware not allow key map ( programmable ) , only adjust couple keys by 6 port dip switch at back side. (original, discontinued)
- [V60 Type R](https://www.kbparadise.com/v60type-r) , use open source firmware , end user can programmable via QMK / TMK / TKG tool. (no DIP switch, so fits more cases but supports & needs programming if changing keys) 
- [V60 Type R Polestar](https://www.kbparadise.com/v60type-r) same as type R but with RGB underglow.
- [V60the2](https://www.kbparadise.com/v60the2) unreleased (feb 2021)

### jargon for casual keyboard-people
When people say v60 they might mean any of the v60 versions with any of the switches.
There is a difference between models so try figure out what they are talking about.
example:
- v60 has dip switches on back
- v60 type R has a reset button instead

when anyone says v60 Mattias, the mattias refers to the switches. same with v60 cherry brown, or v60 khali blue

# modify key mapping

(at the time of writing this, the keyboard is not fully supported by qmk.)

## VIA
- [via repo](https://github.com/the-via/keyboards) 
- [git releases](https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases/tag/v1.3.1)
- official website: https://caniusevia.com/

not much info on the repo or the website so here is a description

**description:**
 it is an application that allows you to change the keys, lighting options and configure your QMK Keyboard instantly, without the necessity of flashing a hex file. With V1, weâ€™ve added a bunch of new features including but not limited to, a keyboard/matrix tester, macro support, custom keycodes, configurable layouts and a mode for keyboard designers to test their integration.
 
 Via is built on QMK. If your keyboard is on the caniusevia.com list, youâ€™ll still need to have a VIA-compatible firmware loaded. It may or may not have one already, but you can download and flash it if it doesnâ€™t. You can tell by just launching the Via software with the keyboard plugged in. it will detect your keyboard if it does. (plug directly in your pc instead of a USB hub)
 
 see this reddit post for a img preview https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/kzffd3/help_with_via/
 
 tried it but doesn't work with current windows release (17/02/2021)
 they have added kb paradise files in their repo though

from what i understand VIA is build on top of QMK 

## QMK

QMK repo https://github.com/edwinclement08/qmk-firmware/tree/237dd23491cff3dc60df123a8992301bd1d8a9c8
(13 days ago VIA support was added to QMK)

## modify fn key virtually

### spacefn
virtually remap fn key to spacebar. hold spacebar + key will use spacebar as fn key. pressing spacebar will act as normal space bar. Bonus. It works with any keyboard ðŸ˜Š
- [original post on spacefn concept 2015](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51069.350) 
- use TouchCursor on windows, download [here](http://touchcursor.sourceforge.net/)

- backup on repo

note: it mentions fn-return unlocks arrow keymode, marked by led at return.
this doesnt work on my non led v60 type R
backlight shortkeys obviously also don't work

### case compatibility
- a [reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/6h0tom/anne_pro_vs_kbparadise_v60/diul7fk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) mentions it's  easy to swap out the case of the v60 (but doesn't specify which v60). 
- A [youtube review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GbpDFgE6Mo) on the original V60 mentions that isn't the case because of the massive DIP switch on the back, making it incompatible with most cases. 
- the V60 type R doesn't has the DIP switch so might fit other cases better.

### keycap compatibility
should fit any standard 60% layout keys, any cherry caps types
so compatible with most PBT keys out there.
TODO add source
