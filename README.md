# kbpv6000-resources
resources for the kbp v6000 kb paradise v60 type R

# models
available in led, non led
v 60
v 60 type R (newer)
...

# keycap support
should fit any standard 60% layout keys, any cherry caps types
so compatible with most PBT keys out there.
TODO add source

when people say v60 they might mean any of the v60 versions with any of the switches
there is a difference between models so try figure out what they are talking about
example:
- v60 has dip switches on back
- v60 type R has a reset button instead

when anyone says v60 Mattias, the mattias refers to the switches. same with v60 cherry brown, or v60 khali blue

case
reddit posts mentions v60 is easy to swap out case https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/6h0tom/anne_pro_vs_kbparadise_v60/diul7fk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
but a youtube video mentions that isn't the case because of the massive DIP switch on the back, making it incompatible with most cases
